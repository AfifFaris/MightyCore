#Wiring reference
To extend this core's functionality a bit futher, I've added a few missing Wiring functions. As many of you know Arduino is based on Wiring, but that doesn't mean the Wiring development isnt active. These functions is used as "regular" Arduino functions, and there's no need to include an external library.
